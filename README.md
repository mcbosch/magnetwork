    <h1>The Magnetic Graph Package</h1>
    <p>Magnetic Graphs are a useful mathematical object for modelling (***). Moreover, it's a good way to treat directed graphs as symetric, so the Laplacian has better properties, but we preserve the directionality information in an other way. See this <a>survey on Magnetic Graphs</a> for more detailed information. </p>
    <p>Even thought all it's useful applications there isn't any package that works with this type of graphs. Thus, in this repository we build a basic package to work these objects. In future versions I'll try to merge this package with packages such as <em>PyTorch</em> or <em>networkx</em>, so more people can use these graphs for their projects on quantum physics or Graph Neural Networks with directed graphs.</p>
    <p>This repository is focused on working with spectral information, to contribute with an easy tool to manipulate, create and visualize different magnetic graphs and it's spectrum. Please, if you use this repo on research projects, cyte me as <a>cite cite</a>. If you like the project, please give it a star so it reaches more people and researchers.</p>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>For tnis package I inspired, and based my project on the <a href="https://github.com/networkx/networkx/tree/main" target="_blank">NetworkX</a> python package. We do it in this way so we can extend to more global and well stablished packages. Nevertheless I'll try to keep this repository simple, so for those that want to experiment with Magnetic Graphs, and they want to have a better understandinng or flexibility in the code for modifications.</p>
        <p>So let's give a bigpicture on how it's structured our repository and how it's structured the code.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Let's introduce some examples of Magnetic Graphs and different potentianls. In this section we'll see the MagGrid and the MagCycle, and we'll take a look to the spectrum of these graphs.</p>
