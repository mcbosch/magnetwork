class MagGraph:
    """
    Base class for magnetic graphs.
    
    A magnetic graph stoores the nodes and edges with optional data. The edges are considered directed, but we have the two directions for each edge. Also, we have a potential function that assigns a value between 0 and 2pi to each edge. 

    Self-loops are allowed but multiedges are not. The only restriction for nodes is tha they must be a hashable python object.
